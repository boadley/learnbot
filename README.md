`we'll put some dope images here`

## Elevator Pitch 
Personalised AI based Chatbot as Studying Partner. For every self learner, every time, everywhere. 
The bot has spaced repetition algorithm implemented to ensure that what is learnt is never forgotten. 

## Inspiration
Many countries, despite having significantly increased access to education for their children and youth, now realize that they are facing a learning crisis. For instance, when grade 3 students in Nicaragua were tested in 2011, only half correctly solved 5 plus 6. And in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, when grade 3 students were asked recently to read a sentence such as “The name of the dog is Puppy,” three-quarters could not answer what the dog’s name was. Examples like these from around the world underline that schooling is not the same as learning—even though education policy often assumes that it is.

What if every child can have their own personal teacher?
What if we can truly tell when learning has occurred and a subject has been committed to long term memory?
```

## Problem
- The problem in education; One big reason the learning crisis persists is that many education systems across the developing world have little information on who is learning and who is not - World Bank - JANUARY 17, 2019
- The world is facing a learning crisis. While countries have significantly increased access to education, being in school isn’t the same thing as learning
- Worldwide, hundreds of millions of children reach young adulthood without even the most basic skills like calculating the correct change from a transaction, reading a doctor’s instructions, or understanding a bus schedule—let alone building a fulfilling career or educating their children.

## Proposed Solution
- It’s never too late for young people to have opportunities to learn. 
- Technology is already playing a crucial role in providing support to teachers, students, and the learning process more broadly. And technology can allow principals, parents, and students to interact seamlessly.

## LearnBot Features
- Enable parents and teachers to track lesson completion rates of students. (Lesson remembrance rates, among other metrics). 
- Coerce students to repractice what they've learnt to ensure optimal remembrance. (Using highly effective spaced repetition algorithm).
- Personalize the learning experience for each student (Every child is different, just ask my mom).

## What it does
LearnBot acts as a study partner and a friend to chat with in terms of learning.
 - It asks you question about what you've learned
 - It tracks how many questions you got correct and how fast you answered correctly
 - Using the open-source spaced repetition algorithm developed by [Dr. Piotr Wozniak](https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/english/ol/sm2), LearnBot tracks the optimal `next practice time` to ensure the lessons are committed to long term memory 

**There are two reasons why**
 - It contributes towards a global effort to accelerate more and better investments in people for greater equity and economic growth.
 - It ensures that learning can be tracked and drivers of learning can be discovered. With the help of AI, LearnBot can be personalized to the specific learning needs of every child.

## How we built it
We built the UI with Wordpress and built the chatbot with python and Snatchbot chatbot deployment platform.

## Challenges we ran into
Agreeing on a design for the project and building the chatbot

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 
Integrating the chatbot into the UI of the site

## What we learned
- How to build chatbots
- Somethings about User Interface Design
- Business skills. such as building a team, coming up with ideas and validating them.

## What's next for Learn Bot
If we get the funding we are ready to start building more lessons for the bot and testing the app in the real world to see how students and teachers are going to react.
